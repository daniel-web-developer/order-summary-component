## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

By coding this project, I learned how to use anchor elements (<a></a>) as buttons and I've used lists on a context I haven't used before (until now, I've only used lists in the header/navbar). I also learned how to use an image as the background.

### Continued development

In this project, I've had the same problem I experienced in the last one I uploaded [QR Code Component](https://github.com/daniel-web-developer/qr-code-repository). I can't get the measurements 100% right because I don't have a premium account so I can check them.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) - This helped me because I haven't used an image as the background before.
